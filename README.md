## High level overview
The diagram below illustrates C3 in the context of a basic value chain.

- C3 Certs get created by audited green energy producers.
- These Certs are then used to reward energy distributors and consumers (Factory).
- The Certs can travel throughout value chains, all the way to the retailer or end-consumer.
- Cert holders can sell them to partially recover their investment costs or make a profit.
- Certs are bought for many reasons: investment, ESG policies, carbon offset proxy, digital currency.
